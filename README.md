# 2D-Rocket-Landing


# Plant

A 2D Rocket having 3-DOF (two position x & y) and one orientation (rotation about the axis normal to the plane). The rocket is equipped with a rotatable thruster attached to its bottom that can be used to apply thrust at an angle to control the position and orientation.

# Goal

The goal of the controller is to apply an energy based lyapunov controller that controls the thrust force and the angle of the thruster to control the position and orienation of the rocket so that, when it's falling under gravity from the sky, we should be able to safely land it on the ground.
